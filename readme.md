## Examples
This is still in early development. For latest examples on how to use the various interfaces, see the
[tests](https://github.com/refractionPOINT/limacharlie-js/blob/master/test/test.js).
Also note that the interfaces are directly based (and map to) the ones in the [Python API](https://github.com/refractionpoint/python-limacharlie)
which is better documented.
